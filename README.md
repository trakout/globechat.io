## Description
Team Banana Stand presents to you GlobeChat.io! [Check it out!](http://globechat.io)

We also have a [Koding VM URL!](http://utkkf5ff034f.trakout.koding.io/)

GlobeChat.io is a video chatting service that lets you talk to anyone in the world. There are many like this (Omegle and ChatRoulette] but where we differ from them is that we also provide translation. So, really, you can talk to anyone in the world!

So, you select a language that you will speak in. Then, invite someone to chat with you.

As you speak, your chat buddy will receive a text translation of everything you say and type, in their langauge.

But, what do I talk to them about? We've got you covered! On the right pane, you can find information about your new friend's area!
